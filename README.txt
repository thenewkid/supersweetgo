This is the beginning of a project of developing an amazing application to play Go. Long-term
goals include having a user-based website, mobile apps, and a free-mium business model. As of
right now the only substantial way to play Go against friends online or via mobile apps is via
panda net - but as far as I can tell, development stopped in 2012 and many features have yet
to be implemented, including having a friends list.

One of the most important features we want to implement is the ability to play UN-timed games,
so that you can play Go anytime (like scrabble with words with friends). Especially with a game
like Go, where a solid game can take a long time, we want people to be able to play with friends
in all capacities. We hope this will attract more people to the game and make it more fun by making
it more social. We'll probably integrate it into facebook, twitter, and other social apps.

BUT, and this is the most important thing... I, We, are creating this because it doesn't exist and I
want it! I have friends I won't to play Go but can't dedicate a full 1.5 hour everytime I want to play.
